# LAB2

### Lab purpose


In this lab you will create a basic chat room. We are going to put to use the
skills from lab 1 and will also learn how to create and use a Mix project.

Try to complete this lab without using the `List` and `Enum` modules.


### Lab instructions

Create a new mix project with `mix new my_lab2`.

The `lab2` directory has a file `room.ex` which contains an implementation of chat
room with some stubbed out functions. Copy the file to `lib/` in your project.
Implement the functions.

Start an interactive shell with the modules in your project available with
`$ iex -S mix`, your code can be tested from the shell.

  1. Implement the `leave/2` function. Raise an error if the user leaving was not previously a member of the room.

  2. Implement the `new_message/3` function. A suggestion for the message type is to use a map with the fields `:user` and `:text`.

  3. Implement the function `messages_by_user/2`. Return all messages authored by the given user.


##### Advanced user problems (if you have more time)

  1. Add a `:created_at` field to messages and sort them based on creation time.
     (TIP: Represent time by a single integer and use `Enum.sort/2`)

  2. Filter messages returned by `messages_by_user/2` that was created within a
     specific time frame.
