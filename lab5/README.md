# LAB5

### Lab purpose

This lab will expand on the second lab. An `Agent` will be used to wrap the room
state in a process.

Some of your code can be reused from the second lab or you can grab the code
from the file with solutions in the `lab2` directory.


### Lab instructions

Create a new mix project with `mix new lab5`.

The `lab5` directory has a file `room.ex` which contains an implementation of chat
room with some stubbed out functions. Copy the file to `lib/` in your project.
Implement the functions.

Start an interactive shell with the modules in your project available with
`$ iex -S mix`, your code can be tested from the shell.

  1. Implement the leave/2 function.

  2. Implement the members/1 function, it should return a list of members in the
     room.

  3. Implement the new_message/3 function.

  4. Implement the messages_by_user/2 function.


##### Advanced user problems (if you have more time)

  1. If there is enough time try to implement the process as a `GenServer` or
     as a normal process with spawn/send/receive. What differences do you notice
     from the `Agent` version and when would you use an Agent instead of
     GenServer?
